# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for documenting and analyzing the requirements for a booking management system as part of the FeatureForge project. The purpose of this repository is to emulate a real-world software requirement analysis process, focusing on creating a detailed blueprint for the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Through structured documentation, diagrams, and well-defined requirements, this project aims to establish a solid foundation for successful project execution, ensuring clarity, precision, and alignment with business and user goals.
